## Setup

1. Install [Unreal Engine 4.25](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation/index.html), [Visual Studio](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/index.html), and any dependencies.
2. Clone the repo with ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/BwdYeti/VectorWarUE4.git```, or after downloading run ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` to download the [GGPOUE4](https://github.com/BwdYeti/GGPOUE4) submodule.
3. (optional) Generate project files (Right click VectorWarUE4.uproject, ```Generate Visual Studio project files```).
4. Open VectorWarUE4.uproject

## Controls

Arrow keys: Move
D: Fire
P: Network Performance Monitor

### Notes

Unreal Engine is not deterministic, which is required for netcode that only sends inputs between players, such as deterministic lockstep (delay based) or rollback. VectorWarUE4 gets around this by running the original VectorWar code as its own game state, separate from the UE game logic. It only uses UE for reading player inputs, maintaining the update tick frequency, and rendering the game state by matching Unreal actors to the game state objects they represent. Similar solutions will be required for your own projects.

Currently GGPOUE4 is only usable with Windows.
